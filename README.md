Finally starting to learn how to use CSS! Hopefully this website
will look a lot cooler than the one that I am working on. This is a little bit challenging, but it will be alright. Probably will spend the rest of the day grinding out and working on this kind of stuff, while I just finish up the rest of the work that I need to do. Hopefully this will actually help me completely fix everything up that I need to. Yippee!
